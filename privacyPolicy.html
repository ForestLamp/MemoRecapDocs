<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 1, 2026<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 1, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MemoRecap</strong> (the “Application”) collects, uses, and protects your personal data.</p>

<p>
<strong>Data Controller:</strong><br>
Aleksei Chusovitin<br>
Email: lapki.alex@gmail.com<br>
Jurisdiction: Republic of Serbia
</p>

<p>
By installing, accessing, or using the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Storage Architecture</h2>

<p>The Application does not operate backend servers for storing user content.</p>

<p>All user-generated data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice recordings</li>
<li>Transcripts</li>
<li>AI-generated summaries</li>
<li>Custom AI prompts</li>
</ul>

<p>
is stored locally on your device and/or in your personal iCloud account (if enabled).
</p>

<p>
We do not have technical access to, and cannot retrieve or restore, your recordings or summaries.
You are solely responsible for backups and iCloud synchronization.
</p>

<h2>2. Data We Collect and Process</h2>

<h3>2.1 User Content</h3>
<p>
User content is processed solely to provide Application functionality.
We do not access, store, monitor, or use your content for any independent purpose.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Analytics Data</h3>
<p>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (Google LLC) to improve the Application.</p>

<ul>
<li>Device type and model</li>
<li>iOS version</li>
<li>Feature usage statistics</li>
<li>Crash logs</li>
<li>Anonymized device identifiers</li>
<li>Approximate country-level location</li>
</ul>

<p>Firebase does NOT collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your recordings</li>
<li>Your transcripts</li>
<li>Your AI-generated summaries</li>
<li>Precise location</li>
</ul>

<p>Analytics data is retained by Firebase for up to 14 months under Google’s policies.</p>

<h3>2.3 Subscription Data</h3>
<p>
Payments are processed exclusively by Apple via the App Store.
We do not access payment card or billing details.
</p>

<p>
Subscription validation is handled via AppHud.
AppHud processes subscription metadata only (tier, expiration, transaction identifiers).
</p>

<h2>3. AI Processing</h2>

<h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Providers</h3>

<p>
When you use transcription or summary features, your recording or text is temporarily transmitted to third-party AI providers such as <strong>Replicate, Inc.</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Processing occurs only when you actively request transcription or summarization.
</p>

<p>
We do not store AI inputs or outputs on our servers.
</p>

<p>
We do not authorize or permit the use of your content for training AI models.
AI providers process data under their own privacy policies and data processing agreements.
</p>

<p>
AI providers may retain inputs and outputs temporarily for operational, debugging, abuse prevention, or compliance purposes, typically for a limited period (for example, up to 30 days), in accordance with their policies.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Legal Responsibility for AI Outputs</h3>

<p>
AI outputs are generated automatically by third-party systems beyond our direct control.
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge and agree that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>AI outputs may contain inaccuracies or errors</li>
<li>AI outputs are for informational purposes only</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for verifying AI-generated content</li>
<li>You assume all risks associated with AI-generated results</li>
</ul>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors in transcription or summaries</li>
<li>Decisions made based on AI outputs</li>
<li>Consequences of modifying AI prompts</li>
<li>Content generated through custom prompts</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (EU Users)</h2>

<p>For users located in the European Union, processing is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance of a contract (providing Application functionality)</li>
<li>User consent (AI processing and analytics)</li>
<li>Legitimate interest (security and service improvement)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>
Your data may be processed in jurisdictions outside your country of residence, including the United States.
</p>

<p>
Where required, transfers rely on safeguards provided by service providers, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</li>
<li>Data Processing Agreements</li>
<li>Applicable adequacy decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>
We rely on contractual safeguards implemented by our service providers.
