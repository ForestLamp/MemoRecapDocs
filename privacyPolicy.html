<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 1, 2026</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 1, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MemoRecap</strong> (the "Application") collects, uses, and protects your personal data.</p>

<p>
<strong>Data Controller:</strong><br>
Aleksei Chusovitin<br>
Email: lapki.alex@gmail.com<br>
Jurisdiction: Republic of Serbia
</p>

<p>
By using the Application, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our 
<a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Storage Architecture</h2>
<p>The Application does not use its own backend servers to store user content.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Voice recordings and transcripts are stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>iCloud:</strong> If enabled, data is synced via your personal Apple iCloud account. We have no access to your iCloud files.</li>
</ul>

<div class="important">
<strong>Important:</strong> We do not have technical access to, and cannot retrieve or restore, your recordings or summaries. 
You are solely responsible for managing backups and iCloud synchronization.
</div>

<h2>2. Data We Collect and Process</h2>

<h3>2.1 User Content</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Voice recordings</li>
    <li>Transcripts</li>
    <li>AI-generated summaries</li>
    <li>Custom AI prompts</li>
</ul>
<p>
User content is processed solely to provide Application functionality and is not accessed or stored by us for independent purposes.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Analytics Data (Firebase)</h3>
<p>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (Google LLC) to improve performance and stability.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type and model</li>
    <li>iOS version</li>
    <li>App usage statistics</li>
    <li>Crash reports</li>
    <li>Anonymized device identifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Analytics data does <strong>not</strong> include your recordings, transcripts, or summaries.
Retention period: up to 14 months under Google’s policies.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Subscription Data (AppHud)</h3>
<p>Payments are processed exclusively by Apple via the App Store.</p>
<p>We do not access payment card or billing details.</p>
<p>AppHud processes subscription metadata only (tier, status, expiration, transaction identifiers).</p>

<h2>3. AI Processing</h2>

<h3>3.1 Third-Party AI Providers</h3>
<p>
When you use transcription or summary features, your recording or text is temporarily transmitted to <strong>Replicate, Inc.</strong> via encrypted TLS connection.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Processing occurs only when you actively request transcription or summarization.</li>
    <li>We do not store AI inputs or outputs on our servers.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not authorize</strong> the use of your data for AI model training.</li>
</ul>

<p>
According to Replicate’s policies, inputs and outputs may be retained temporarily (for example, up to 30 days) for debugging, abuse prevention, and operational purposes, after which they are deleted in accordance with their policies.
</p>

<h3>3.2 AI Accuracy & User Responsibility</h3>

<p>
AI outputs are generated automatically by third-party systems beyond our direct control.
</p>

<div class="important">
AI-generated transcripts and summaries may contain inaccuracies or errors and are provided for informational purposes only.  
They should not be relied upon for medical, legal, financial, or professional decisions.
</div>

<p>
You may customize AI prompts and instructions. You are solely responsible for the content and configuration of custom prompts and for verifying AI-generated outputs before relying on them.
We do not review, monitor, or control user-defined prompts.
</p>

<h2>4. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>
When using AI features or analytics, data may be processed outside your country of residence, including the United States.
</p>

<p>
We rely on contractual safeguards implemented by our service providers (such as Data Processing Agreements and Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable).
</p>

<h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>Depending on your location (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), you may have rights including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Access</li>
    <li>Correction</li>
    <li>Deletion</li>
    <li>Restriction of processing</li>
    <li>Data portability</li>
    <li>Withdrawal of consent</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since user content is stored locally, you can delete it directly in the Application or by uninstalling it.
</p>

<p>

We respond within the timeframe required by applicable law.
