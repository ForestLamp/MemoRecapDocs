</p>

<p>
By installing, accessing, or using the Application, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (incorporated by reference).
</p>

<div class="important">
<p class="caps">Important Notice:</p>
<p>This Application involves AI-generated content and user-configurable AI prompts. You are solely responsible for all content you create, store, or generate through the Application, including any modifications to AI instructions. By using this Application, you accept all risks associated with AI-generated outputs.</p>

<p>All user-generated data, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Voice recordings</li>
    <li>Transcripts</li>
    <li>AI-generated summaries</li>
    <li>Custom AI prompts and instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<p>This content is processed solely to provide Application functionality and is not accessed, stored, or used by the Data Controller for any other purpose.</p>

<h3>2.2 Analytics Data</h3>
<p>The Application uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (provided by Google LLC) to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analyze feature usage patterns</li>
    <li>Improve performance and stability</li>

</p>

<h3>2.3 Subscription Management</h3>
<p>
Payments and subscriptions are processed exclusively by Apple Inc. via the App Store.
We do not have access to payment card information, billing addresses, or full payment details.
</p>
<p>
The Application uses <strong>AppHud</strong> (provided by AppHud Inc.) to manage subscription status and entitlement validation.

<h2>3. AI Processing and Third-Party Services</h2>

<h3>3.1 AI Service Providers</h3>
<p>
To provide transcription and summary features, voice recordings and/or text may be temporarily transmitted to third-party AI service providers, specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Replicate, Inc.</strong> (for AI model inference, including transcription and text generation)</li>
    <li>Other AI providers as may be implemented in future updates</li>
</ul>
<p>
Transmission occurs <strong>solely at the user's explicit request</strong> when using transcription or summary features.
</p>
<p>
<strong>About Replicate:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Replicate is a cloud platform that runs AI models. When you use transcription or summary features, your audio/text is sent to Replicate's infrastructure to process through AI models (such as Whisper for transcription and various language models for summaries). Replicate processes this data on our behalf as a data processor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Important Limitations:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not store user recordings on our servers.</li>
    <li>We do not use user content to train AI models.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or distribute user data to third parties.</li>
    <li>Replicate processes data in accordance with its privacy policy and may retain data temporarily for service operation, abuse prevention, and compliance purposes.</li>
    <li>Replicate's data retention policies apply to data processed through their platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 User Responsibility for AI Prompts</h3>
<div class="important">
<p>
Users may modify the instructions (prompts) used to generate AI summaries.
<strong>Users are solely and exclusively responsible for:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The content and configuration of custom AI prompts</li>
    <li>Any AI outputs generated using modified prompts</li>
    <li>Compliance with applicable laws when using AI features</li>
    <li>All risks associated with modifying default AI instructions</li>
    <li>Ensuring AI-generated content does not violate third-party rights</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Data Controller is not responsible for reviewing, monitoring, or controlling user-configured AI prompts or the outputs they generate.
</p>
</div>

<h2>4. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
When AI services or analytics providers are used, data may be processed in countries outside the user's country of residence, including the United States.
</p>
<p>
Where required by applicable law (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation), we rely on the following safeguards:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission</li>
    <li>Adequacy decisions by competent authorities</li>
    <li>Data Processing Agreements with service providers</li>
    <li>Compliance with third-party providers' privacy frameworks (e.g., EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework)</li>
</ul>
<p>
By using the Application, you consent to the transfer of your data to these jurisdictions.
</p>

<h2>5. User Rights (GDPR and Applicable Privacy Laws)</h2>
<p>
Users in jurisdictions that provide data protection rights (including the European Union, United Kingdom, California, and other regions) may have the following rights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of your personal data</li>
    <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Correct inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
    <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request deletion of your data ("right to be forgotten")</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Limit how we process your data</li>
    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Receive your data in a machine-readable format</li>
    <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to certain types of processing</li>
    <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> Withdraw previously given consent</li>
    <li><strong>Complaint:</strong> Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Exercise of Rights:</strong>
Since user data is stored locally on your device and/or in your personal iCloud account, you may:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Delete data at any time within the Application settings</li>
    <li>Uninstall the Application to remove all local data</li>
    <li>Manage iCloud data through your Apple account settings</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
We will respond to verified requests within 30 days (or as required by applicable law).
</p>

For specific retention details, refer to <a href="https://replicate.com/privacy" style="color: #6c9ef8;">Replicate's Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data during transmission, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit</li>
    <li>Industry-standard API authentication mechanisms</li>
    <li>Limited access to third-party service credentials</li>
    <li>Regular security reviews of third-party providers</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>However,</strong> no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and iCloud account.
</p>
