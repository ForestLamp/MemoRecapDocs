</p>

<h3>6.2 AI-Generated Content Disclaimers</h3>
<div class="important">

<h3>6.3 Third-Party Services</h3>

The Application relies on third-party services (including Apple, iCloud, Firebase, AppHud, and AI providers).
We are not responsible for downtime, changes, discontinuation, or failures of third-party services.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<strong>Total aggregate liability</strong> for any claim relating to the Application will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the Application
in the <strong>12 months</strong> preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law (for example, certain consumer rights or liability for intentional misconduct where applicable).
</p>

<h2>8. Indemnification</h2>

</p>

<h2>9. Termination</h2>
<p>
You may stop using the Application at any time by uninstalling it. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or misuse the Service.
Termination does not affect provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g., disclaimers and limitation of liability).
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms from time to time. The current version will be available within the Application or via the link provided in the app.
Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
If you do not agree, you must stop using the Application.
</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

<h3>11.1 Governing Law</h3>
<p>
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Serbia, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.
However, if you are a consumer, you may also benefit from mandatory consumer protection laws in your country/state of residence.
</p>

<h3>11.2 Informal Resolution</h3>
<p>
Before filing a claim, you agree to contact us at <a href="mailto:lapki.alex@gmail.com">lapki.alex@gmail.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
</p>

<h3>11.3 Courts / Venue</h3>
<p>
If you are using the Application on behalf of a business (or where consumer protections do not apply), disputes shall be brought in the competent courts in Serbia,
unless mandatory law requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
If you are a consumer, you may bring claims in the courts of your place of residence where required or permitted by mandatory law.
</p>

<h2>12. Apple-Specific Terms</h2>
<p>
You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and the Service Provider, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the Application or its content.
Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.
